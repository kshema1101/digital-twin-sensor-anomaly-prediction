# digital-twin-sensor-anomaly-prediction
develop a simulated environment for predictive maintenance using a digital twin model, AI-driven analytics, and edge computing.

1. Introduction
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive simulation environment to predict machine maintenance needs using a digital twin, AI-driven analytics, and edge computing. The project aims to demonstrate the integration of these advanced technologies within a time-constrained, resource-limited setup, specifically designed for predictive maintenance scenarios.

2. Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to create a simulated ecosystem that mimics the operation of a physical machine, uses AI to predict maintenance needs, and simulates the deployment of this predictive model on edge computing infrastructure. The specific objectives include:

Digital Twin Development: Develop a digital twin of a simple machine (e.g., a rotating motor) that generates synthetic sensor data, such as temperature and vibration readings, mimicking real-world operations and potential failure scenarios.

AI Model Creation: Train an AI model capable of analyzing the synthetic data to predict when maintenance is required, thereby reducing the likelihood of machine failure and optimizing operational efficiency.

Edge Deployment Simulation: Simulate the deployment of the trained AI model on edge computing infrastructure, demonstrating how predictive maintenance can be performed locally, minimizing latency and improving real-time decision-making.

Project Title: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance Simulation with Digital Twins and Edge Computing
Timeline: 4 Weeks (10 hours per week)

Objective: To develop a simulated environment for AI-driven predictive maintenance using a digital twin model, deployable on edge computing infrastructure. The project will emphasize software development, data analysis, and cloud deployment techniques, all using accessible tools and frameworks.

Week 1: Setup and Planning
Define Scope & Requirements (2 hours)

Clearly outline the project's scope: focus on simulating a machine (e.g., a simple rotating motor or HVAC system) using a digital twin.
Identify key metrics for predictive maintenance (e.g., temperature, vibration, usage hours).
Technology Stack Setup (4 hours)

Software: Install Python, Docker, and any necessary libraries (TensorFlow, Flask for APIs, etc.).
Cloud Platforms: Set up accounts for AWS or Azure (using free tiers) to explore edge computing tools like AWS Greengrass or Azure IoT Edge.
Version Control: Initialize a GitHub repository to track progress.
Initial Research & Design (4 hours)

Research digital twin models and select one to simulate in software.
Design the system architecture, including data flow between the digital twin, the AI model, and edge deployment.
Week 2: Digital Twin & Data Generation
Digital Twin Development (5 hours)

Use Python to create a simple digital twin of the chosen machine. Simulate sensor data (e.g., temperature, vibrations) using mathematical models.
Implement a basic dashboard in Python (using libraries like Dash or Flask) to visualize the simulated data.
Data Collection & Preprocessing (5 hours)

Generate synthetic data using the digital twin, simulating normal operation and various fault conditions.
Preprocess the data for training, including normalization and segmentation of time-series data.
Week 3: AI Model Development
Model Training (5 hours)

Train an AI model for predictive maintenance using the preprocessed data. Start with simple models like Decision Trees or Random Forests, and then experiment with more complex models like LSTM for time-series forecasting.
Validate the model by testing it against new synthetic data, refining as necessary.
Model Evaluation & Documentation (5 hours)

Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Document the model architecture, training process, and evaluation results.
Week 4: Edge Deployment & Final Integration
Edge Simulation Setup (5 hours)

Containerize the AI model using Docker, and simulate its deployment on an edge device using a local VM or lightweight cloud instance.
Implement a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate model updates.
Project Integration & Final Testing (5 hours)

Integrate the digital twin, AI model, and edge deployment. Test the entire system for data flow, model inference, and update deployment.
Record a demo video showcasing the system's functionality.
