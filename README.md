# digital-twin-sensor-anomaly-prediction
develop a simulated environment for predictive maintenance using a digital twin model, AI-driven analytics, and edge computing.

1. Introduction
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive simulation environment to predict machine maintenance needs using a digital twin, AI-driven analytics, and edge computing. The project aims to demonstrate the integration of these advanced technologies within a time-constrained, resource-limited setup, specifically designed for predictive maintenance scenarios.

2. Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to create a simulated ecosystem that mimics the operation of a physical machine, uses AI to predict maintenance needs, and simulates the deployment of this predictive model on edge computing infrastructure. The specific objectives include:

Digital Twin Development: Develop a digital twin of a simple machine (e.g., a rotating motor) that generates synthetic sensor data, such as temperature and vibration readings, mimicking real-world operations and potential failure scenarios.

AI Model Creation: Train an AI model capable of analyzing the synthetic data to predict when maintenance is required, thereby reducing the likelihood of machine failure and optimizing operational efficiency.

Edge Deployment Simulation: Simulate the deployment of the trained AI model on edge computing infrastructure, demonstrating how predictive maintenance can be performed locally, minimizing latency and improving real-time decision-making.
